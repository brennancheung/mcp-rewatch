# Error Handling Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the error handling enhancements implemented in the MCP Rewatch codebase.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Configuration Loading (src/index.ts)
- ✅ Added file existence check before reading config
- ✅ Validates JSON structure after parsing
- ✅ Validates each process configuration
- ✅ Provides specific error messages for:
  - Missing config file (with reference to example)
  - Invalid JSON syntax
  - Permission denied errors
  - Invalid config structure

### 2. Process Spawn Error Handling (src/process-manager.ts)
- ✅ Added spawn event listener for immediate success detection
- ✅ Handles specific error codes:
  - `ENOENT`: Command not found
  - `EACCES`: Permission denied
  - `ENOTDIR`: Invalid working directory  
  - `EMFILE`: Too many open files
- ✅ Improved exit code logging with context

### 3. Tool Input Validation (src/index.ts)
- ✅ Added try-catch blocks to all tool handlers
- ✅ Validates all input parameters:
  - Process names (non-empty strings)
  - Line counts (1-10000 range)
- ✅ Checks if processes exist before operations
- ✅ Shows available processes when invalid name provided

### 4. Process Termination (src/process-manager.ts)
- ✅ Added detailed logging for signal attempts
- ✅ Implemented cleanup guard to prevent multiple calls
- ✅ Extended timeout to 5 seconds before SIGKILL
- ✅ Handles kill failures gracefully
- ✅ Logs reason for process stop

### 5. Graceful Shutdown (src/index.ts)
- ✅ Added SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers
- ✅ Stops all processes before exit
- ✅ Differentiates between startup and runtime errors
- ✅ Attempts cleanup even on fatal errors
- ✅ Specific error messages for:
  - Lost connection (EPIPE)
  - Transport failures
  - General startup errors

### 6. Log Buffer Protection (src/log-buffer.ts)
- ✅ Truncates lines over 5000 characters
- ✅ Removes multiple lines when over limit
- ✅ Error handling for timestamp generation
- ✅ Fallback error logging
- ✅ Ensures buffer doesn't grow unbounded even in error cases

## Error Message Improvements

All error messages now include:
- **Context**: What was being attempted
- **Specificity**: Exact reason for failure
- **Actionability**: What the user can do to fix it
- **Available Options**: Lists valid choices when applicable

## Examples of Improved Error Messages

### Before:
```
Failed to load config from rewatch.config.json: Error
Process error: spawn failed
Error restarting process
```

### After:
```
Configuration file not found at: /path/to/rewatch.config.json
Please create a rewatch.config.json file. See rewatch.config.example.json for reference.

Command 'npm' not found. Check if it's installed and in PATH.

Error: Process 'frontend' not found. Available processes: backend, database
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Debugging**: Developers can quickly identify what went wrong
2. **User-Friendly**: Users get clear instructions on how to fix issues
3. **Robust Operation**: System handles edge cases gracefully
4. **Resource Safety**: Prevents memory leaks and resource exhaustion
5. **Clean Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on exit prevents orphaned processes
